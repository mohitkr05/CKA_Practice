1. Root privileges can be obtained by running 'sudo −i'.
2. Rebooting of your server IS permitted at any time.
3. Do not stop or tamper with the certerminal process as this will END YOUR EXAM SESSION.
4. Do not block incoming ports 8080/tcp, 4505/tcp and 4506/tcp. This includes firewall rules that are found within the distribution's default firewall configuration files as well as interactive firewall commands.
5. Use Ctrl+Alt+W instead of Ctrl+W.
5.1 Ctrl+W is a keyboard shortcut that will close the current tab in Google Chrome.
6. Ctrl+C & and Ctrl+V are not supported in your exam terminal. To copy and paste text, please use;
6.1 For Linux: select text for copy and middle button for paste (or both left and right simultaneously if you have no middle button).
6.2 For Mac: ⌘+C to copy and ⌘+V to paste.
6.3 For Windows: Ctrl+Insert to copy and Shift+Insert to paste.
7. In addition, you might find it helpful to use the Notepad (see top menu under 'Exam Controls') to manipulate text before pasting to the command line.
8. Installation of services and applications included in this exam may require modification of system security policies to successfully complete.
9. Only a single terminal console is available during the exam. Terminal multiplexers such as GNU Screen and tmux can be used to create virtual consoles.
